# Online-Job-Hunting-Backend
The online job hunting web application is a powerful tool designed to help job seekers find their next opportunity.

The backend of the online job hunting web application is built using Spring, a popular Java-based framework for developing enterprise applications. It provides the underlying functionality and logic for the application, and it integrates with the MySQL database to store and retrieve data.

The Spring framework is used to create a RESTful API, which the front-end Angular application can communicate with to retrieve and manipulate data. The API endpoints are secured with Spring security, which provides role based authentication and authorization.

The backend of the application also includes the following features:

Job Management: Allows administrators to create, read, update, and delete jobs from the database.
User Management: Allows administrators to manage user accounts and resumes.
Search: Allows users to search for jobs based on various criteria such as location, job title, and company.
Apply: Allows users to apply for jobs directly through the application.
Job Recommendation: A feature that suggests jobs to users based on their profile and job search history.
Saved job search: Allows users to save their job search for future reference.
Job history: Allows users to see the jobs they have applied for in the past.
The backend of the application is built using the Spring Boot, which makes it easy to develop and deploy the application, it also uses the Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for database access and ORM.

The backend of the application can be deployed in any Java compatible application server and it can be connected to any relational database. It also uses the Swagger to document the API endpoints and test them.
